A monochrome theme for Emacs 24.

Just throw _monochrome-theme.el_ into _~/.emacs.d_ and execute

    M-x load-theme RET monochrome RET

or put in your init file

    (load-theme 'monochrome)

This theme is based on the builtin dichromacy theme, it is basically
white on black, except for errors and a few things.

Patches welcome!
